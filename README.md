# kn1gh7
<h2>Simply a small audispd plugin and scripts that lock network socket creations, what did them, the lineage of processes that made them, all in a human readable format.</h2>
<h3>It's very rough around the edges still, expect errors and manual fixes</h3>

<h2>Known Dependencies</h2>
<p>Any Linux System</p>
<p>Auditd</p>
<p>audispd-plugins</p>
<p>python3</p>
<p>python3-audit</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>I would reccomend using the kn1gh7-setup script.</p>
